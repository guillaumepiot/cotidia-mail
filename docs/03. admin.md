Admin
=====

You can access the notice logs and send notice emails from the admin. To do so, you will need to provide the URLs to the admin views and optionally add a menu item to navigate to it.

Add the following rule to your `urls.py`:

    url(r'^admin/notification/', include('cotimail.urls', namespace="cotimail")),

Register the menu with the account menu manager (in `admin.py`):

    from account.menu import menu
    menu.register("cotimail", "admin/cotimail/menu.html", 1) # 1 being the order id
