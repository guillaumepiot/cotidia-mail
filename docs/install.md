=======

You can install Cotimail from source by downloading the package from BitBucket: [https://bitbucket.org/guillaumepiot/cotimail](https://bitbucket.org/guillaumepiot/cotimail).

	$ python setup.py install

Though it is easier to install it using PIP:

	$ pip install cotimail

If you are a contributor and would like to make source code edit while working on a project, you can install the package in edit mode:

	$ pip install -e git+https://bitbucket.org/guillaumepiot/cotimail.git#egg=cotimail
