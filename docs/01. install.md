#Installation & Setup

Install using PIP straight from the repository:

    $ pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/guillaumepiot/cotimail.git

If you are a contributor and would like to make source code edit while working on a project, you can install the package in edit mode:

    $ pip install -e git+https://bitbucket.org/guillaumepiot/cotimail.git#egg=cotimail
	
Add `cotimail` to your project settings `INSTALLED_APPS`:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'cotimail',
     )

Cotimail uses Mandrill ([Djrill](https://github.com/brack3t/Djrill)) to send email, you will need to enter the API key:

    MANDRILL_API_KEY = "<myapp-api-key>"

Instruct Django to use the Djrill email backend:

    EMAIL_BACKEND = "djrill.mail.backends.djrill.DjrillBackend"

Run the migration:

    $ python manage.py migrate cotimail
